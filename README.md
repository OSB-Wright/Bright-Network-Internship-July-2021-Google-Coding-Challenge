# Bright-Network-Internship-July-2021-Google-Coding-Challenge
This is the work I have done for the Bright Network internship July 2021 Google coding challenge.

All of the code I have added and modified is contained in video_playlist.py and video_player.py.
The aim was to develop a command-line application to simulate Youtube and give me insight into the kind of tasks a software engineer would encounter.
